## Software Developer | Java & Web Technologies

I am a disciplined and detail-focused software developer with hands-on experience in **Java**, **web application development**, and **backend fundamentals**. My work is grounded in understanding how systems function end-to-end, from user input in the browser to server-side logic and data handling.

I prioritize correctness, clarity, and maintainability, and I approach development as both a technical and learning discipline.


## 💡 Technical Focus

**Core Languages**

* Java
* SQL
* HTML & CSS
* JavaScript (fundamentals)

**Backend & Web Development**

* Java Servlets
* JDBC
* HTTP request/response lifecycle
* Form handling and validation
* Redirects and basic session concepts

**Databases**

* MySQL
* Relational database design
* CRUD operations
* Basic query optimization

**Tools & Environment**

* Apache Tomcat
* Maven
* Git & GitHub
* VirtualBox for isolated development environments
* Android Studio (introductory level)


## 🧪 Practical Experience

My repositories reflect:

* Academic and self-driven projects using **Java Servlets**
* Implementation of authentication logic and input validation
* Clean separation between frontend (HTML) and backend (Java)
* Gradual improvement through iteration and debugging

I focus on writing code that is readable, logically structured, and easy to reason about, even in small assignments.



## 🔍 Areas of Ongoing Development

* Strengthening backend architecture skills
* Improving database interaction patterns
* Understanding web security fundamentals
* Writing more modular and reusable Java code
* Adopting professional development workflows



## 🧭 Development Philosophy

* Fundamentals before frameworks
* Simple solutions that work reliably
* Learn by building, breaking, and fixing
* Code should explain itself through structure and clarity



## 📌 Notes

This profile represents my **current skills and learning stage**.
I value steady growth, honest documentation of progress, and building a solid technical foundation.
